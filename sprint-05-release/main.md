# Sprint 05 Release

## 1. We developed a Styleguide which helps designers to get started
Which will be updated here when any changes will be made.

## 2. We developed a design structure
We have developed a structure in our elements that should be used consistently throughout all Ã¦pps and affects different UI elements, such as **buttons**, **dividers**, **notifications** and other elements. In this structure we made a difference in importance of all the elements and is divided in types:

* dramatic (changing/disrupting actions or potentially harmful)
* exciting (makes user click fast in a guided process)
* normal (default, change view, one of many options on a screen)
* boring (alternative actions, not too much focus)
* plain (no focus)

### Different types - Buttons

### Different types - Input fields & Dividers
Input fields and dividers also can make use of the different types, which are used by the buttons. Input fields use a normal and a dramatic state, dividers can be used in all states.

### Buttons in different sizes
All the different types comes in different sizes as well. We advice to use the medium button as a default and the large buttons only in web or tablet Ã¦pps. The different sizes are describes as below:
* smaller (small, but no background)
* small
* medium (default)
* large
