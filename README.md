# æternity Prototypes

## Overview
These are concepts and prototypes of æpps that will run on the æternity blockchain. They can be found in the [github repository](https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-prototypes).

We work in an iterative process consisting of two week [sprints](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/Scrum-sprint), each lasting 2 weeks.

We document our progress and results per sprint here. We encourage designers and developers to join the community by contributing pull requests.

📱 Our æpps are designed mobile first.

📖 Everything we build is open source.

## Quick access designs and styles in Zeplin
All the designs are frequently updated in Zeplin Styleguide, where all the CSS Styles can be viewed. To receive access to the styleguide and the designs, send a request with your email address you used for your [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) account to ray@apeunit.com.

# Getting started as a designer
Designers can make use of the styleguide and shared styles for Sketch. Read below to see how to get started.

## Make use of the æternity Sketch Styleguide
Use our styleguide as a library in order to quickly make use of æternity's UI elements.

Install [Kactus](https://github.com/kactus-io/kactus), clone the Kactus branche, keep track of changes, and create pull requests to merge your branch into master.

Kactus will automatically create `.sketch` files from the directories in this repository. Set up the generated `00-aepp-styleguide.sketch` as a Library in your Sketch preferences.

[Learn more about libraries](https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/libraries/adding-libraries)

## Make use of the shared text styles in Sketch
1. Save the [æternity Text Styles](00-aepp-styleguide/document.json) locally
2. Use the [Shared Style Guide Sketch Plugin](https://github.com/nilshoenson/shared-text-styles), install the plugin and import the æternity Shared Text Style you just downloaded.
