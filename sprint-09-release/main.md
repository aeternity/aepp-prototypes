# Results of last Sprint (09)

## 1. We developed aepps.com and dev.aepps.com
We have developed aepps.com that addresses both consumers and developers.

### Consumer side
The consumer side of the website functions as an introduction to the æternity project and mostly what kind of use cases can be solved with blockchain. This in the form of a showcase, where we differentiate between the aepp hierarchy.
* Identity Manager
* Core æpps (Transfer, Address Book, Blockchain Explorer, Messenger)
* Use Case æpps

## 2. We finalized the design of all the æpp icons
We finalized the æpp icon which we have started in the previous sprint. We clearly have a hierarchy in the different icons:
1. The Identity Manager is the Base æpp, where 2. & 3. can be done.
2. Core æpps are 'pre-installed' and instantly available for the user in order to make use of æternity's core functionalities, such as 'Transfer', 'Messages', 'Address Book' and the 'Blockchain Explorer'.
3. The latest are Use Case æpps, which show the (endless) possibilities of decentralized æpps.
