# Identity Manager æpp

For many new users the Identity Manager aepp will be the first touchpoint with the aeternity blockchain . Either accessing it directly or because they want to use an æpp that requires authorization (to process transactions or profile info) from the Identity Manager æpp. Users will be able to manage their identities, tokens, and applications authorizations within the Identity Manager æpp. 

The Identity Manager æpp will be native app. Other apps can communicate with it to gain authorization from a given identity. Users can have have multiple identities in the Identity Manager æpp. Each identity has a balance of AET (æternity tokens) and can have a profile and a name.

An identity can either be public or private. Private identities make it hard to trace transactions to a person. Public identities are connected to a name and all transactions are publicly visible.

All described concepts are in a very early prototype stage and subject to change/discussion. If you have ideas for improvement, please use the issue board.
