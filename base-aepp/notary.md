## 📃  Create proofs
If no proofs have been created yet, the user starts in the Create proofs view. A conversational interface reduces the options the user can make at the same time by asking simple questions. 

Proofs can be created from different media sources. Files, gallery images, or directly from the camera.

The conversional interface always has two answering options: The primary answer leads to the fastest result, the secondary reveals the underlying complexity.

Whenever it is important to make a consequential decision, a simple A/B question is asked.

## 👀  View originals, 📄  Open receipts, 👐  Compare files, 👉  Share links 
In the detail view of a proof the user can open the original file, if it has been stored to within the process of the proof. The original blockchain transaction can be shown in the browser.  A different file can be picked to compare it directly.
A public link to the proof is shown to share the proof.
