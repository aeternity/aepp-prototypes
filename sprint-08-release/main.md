# Results Last Sprint (08)

## 1. We redesigned the website aepps.com
Which will be a starting point for both consumers and developers. **Consumers** can discover possibilities of Blockchain (æternity in particular) by trying out decentralized æpps. **Developers** will be able to get inspired by the æpps as well, but also be able to 'Get Started' by visiting [dev.aepps.com](http://dev.aepps.com).

The new version will be an update of [the old version](http://aepps.com).

### The homepage
* Starts with an introduction text that addresses both consumers and developers.
* Developers have the possibility to instantly get started, or scroll down to explore the identity manager and the æpps more.
* We assume that consumers are more interested in the consumer facing æpps, therefor these are shown on the homepage.

## 2. We started to a design concept for the æpp icons
We clearly have a hierarchy in the different icons:
1. The Identity Manager is the Base æpp, where 2. & 3. can be done.
2. Core æpps are 'pre-installed' and instantly available for the user in order to make use of æternity's core functionalities, such as 'Transfer', 'Messages', 'Address Book' and the 'Blockchain Explorer'.
3. The latest are Use Case æpps, which show the (endless) possibilities of decentralized æpps.

### Base æpp
Built on the same concept of the logo. The main idea behind this is using a very simple symbol to represent the “operative system” which is able to stand alone and yet be reconnected to the æternity brand. The metaphor of the identity being a circle, and the triad signifies movement and change as the user switches between his identities.

### Primary Icons
Very minimal and using only circular shapes and lines, as per in the æternity logo. The idea is to use the pink for the main icon, and invert the colors on the Primary Services Icons. This way, the color still helps you understand that you are looking at one of the core apps.

### Secondary Icons
For these icons we would allow more flexibility for the designs, being able to use more complex and more figurative symbols (while still keeping the simplicity of the overall designs.

## 3. We started the UX concept for an offline signing functionality
Which prevents the private key from is ever being used on a device that is connected to the internet, in order to minimize the change of losing funds.

1. The user is being prompted that he is dealing with a lot funds, an that he should consider installing a cold wallet
2. With a simple question like: "Do you have an old smartphone?", we try to explain the advantage of a cold wallet.
3. If the user doesn't have an old smartphone, he has the option to install the wallet on the same phone (with a lower security)
